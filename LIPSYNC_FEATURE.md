- Restart the dev server after adding env vars

### "Failed to generate audio"
- Check that your OpenAI API key (OPEN_API_KEY) is valid
- Ensure script is under 4096 characters

### "Lip sync generation failed"
- Ensure image shows a clear face (front-facing works best)
- Check that audio file is valid (MP3, WAV, etc.)
