Prompt writing basics
Note: Maximum prompt length is 480 tokens.
A good prompt is descriptive and clear, and makes use of meaningful keywords and modifiers. Start by thinking of your subject, context, and style.

Subject: The first thing to think about with any prompt is the subject: the object, person, animal, or scenery you want an image of.

Context and background: Just as important is the background or context in which the subject will be placed. Try placing your subject in a variety of backgrounds. For example, a studio with a white background, outdoors, or indoor environments.

Style: Finally, add the style of image you want. Styles can be general (painting, photograph, sketches) or very specific (pastel painting, charcoal drawing, isometric 3D). You can also combine styles.

After you write a first version of your prompt, refine your prompt by adding more details until you get to the image that you want. Iteration is important. Start by establishing your core idea, and then refine and expand upon that core idea until the generated image is close to your vision.

Imagen models can transform your ideas into detailed images, whether your prompts are short or long and detailed. Refine your vision through iterative prompting, adding details until you achieve the perfect result.

Reference specific artists or styles: If you have a particular aesthetic in mind, referencing specific artists or art movements can be helpful.

Enhancing the facial details in your personal and group images: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo (for example, use the word "portrait" in the prompt).
